## Description

    1. swapCase(string)
Description: This function takes a string as input and returns the string with each word's case swapped.
Example: Input string "The Quick Brown Fox" would return "tHE qUICK bROWN fOX".

    2. generateArray(value1, value2)
Description: This function generates an array of integers starting from value1 up to value2, inclusive.
Example: generateArray(-9, 7) would return (-9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).

    3. generatePrimeNumbers(array)
Description: This function takes an array of numbers as input and returns an array containing only the prime numbers from the input arlet ul =document.getElementById("todo-list")ray.
Example: If randomNumbers is [1, 89, 97, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 73, 97], generatePrimeNumbers(randomNumbers) would return [89, 97, 2, 3, 5, 7, 73, 97], as these are the prime numbers from the input array.

# Important Notes:
    1. The swapCase function assumes that words are separated by spaces.
    
    2. In generatePrimeNumbers, it's important to note that 1 is not considered a prime number, and the code reflects this condition. 
        The generatePrimeNumbers function uses a simple prime number check based on divisibility by 2 and 3. While this approach may work for small datasets, for         larger datasets or more stringent prime number requirements, a more optimized prime checking algorithm may be necessary.
